## *Why write another blog?*

Good question. 

True, I already have two blogs: one on [EdTech](https://teachinglearninglearningteaching.wordpress.com/) and another on using [R for data visualization](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/). However, the real question is if there are nearly half a BILLION data science blogs already in existence[^1], why should I write create one? 

Surely any opinion piece I write will have been written better by someone more qualified, right?

As for coding tutorials,
