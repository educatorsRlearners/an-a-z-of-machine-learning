## ***Why another blog?***

Good question. 

True, I already have two blogs: one on [EdTech](https://teachinglearninglearningteaching.wordpress.com/) and another on using [R for data visualization](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/). However, the real question is if a Google search for "data science blog" returns nearly half a BILLION results[^1], why should ***I*** create one? 

Surely any opinion piece I write will have been written better by someone more qualified, right?

As for coding tutorials, again, won't everything I create have already been done by someone with a PhD in computer science[^2]?  

While the answer to both of the questions above is more likely than not **"yes"**, it doesn't detract from the actual aim of this enterprise which is to provide a space for me to solidify my understanding of data science/ machine learning. How? 

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

People who studied in the colleges of science and engineering are usually familiar with the man above: Dr. Richard Feynam famous for his work on quantom mechanics but especially to Americans of my generation for his explanation of the [Challenger disaster](https://youtu.be/raMmRKGkGD4?t=38).

Why do I mention him? Feynman's ["notebook technique"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD-_fcpylcE) is a model for learning anything:   
1. Write down the concept you wish to master
2. Explain the concept in comprehensible language
3. Revise ides/concepts which you can't explain well enough
4. Identify complex areas and think of how to simplify them further (i.e., create analogies)
