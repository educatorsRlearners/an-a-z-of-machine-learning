# Statistics
### [The Cartoon Guide to Statistics](http://www.larrygonick.com/titles/science/the-cartoon-guide-to-statistics/)
'![](http://www.larrygonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Statistics2.jpg)'

This is an engaging reference book which explains key concepts like descriptives statistics, distributions, probability, hypothesis testing.

### [The Manga Guide to Statistics](https://nostarch.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product_full/public/mg_statistics_big.png?itok=A7DJQynq)
'![](https://nostarch.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product/public/mg_statistics_big.png?itok=gXBOGTRP)'

Similiar to the title above, but this book has a plot that runs through it so, if like me, you find analogies easier to remember than forumulas, this is a great book for you.
