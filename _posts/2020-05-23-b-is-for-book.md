# Statistics
### [The Cartoon Guide to Statistics](http://www.larrygonick.com/titles/science/the-cartoon-guide-to-statistics/)

This is an engaging reference book which explains key concepts like descriptives statistics, distributions, probability, hypothesis testing.

### [The Manga Guide to Statistics](https://nostarch.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product_full/public/mg_statistics_big.png?itok=A7DJQynq)

Similar to the title above, but this book has a plot that runs through it so, if like me, you find analogies easier to remember than formulas, this is a great book for you.


# Data Science 

## R

### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)  
![](../images/r4ds.png)
After completing several [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/pevansimpson) courses, I started using R to analyze [test-taker data](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/post/coloring-under-the-lines-in-ggplot/) and this book was my go to reference for the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

### [Geocomputation in R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)
My last position required my team and I to travel throughout East Asia to deliver workshops, presentations, and provide client support and I used this book to teach myself how to make maps to visualize our reach and impact. 

### [Blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)  
I would not have been able to create my previous blog without this book. It is indispensable if you want to create a blog with RStudio. 

## Python
