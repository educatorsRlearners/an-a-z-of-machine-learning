## ***Why another blog?***

Good question. 

True, I already have two blogs: one on [EdTech](https://teachinglearninglearningteaching.wordpress.com/) and another on using [R for data visualization](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/). However, the real question is if a Google search for "data science blog" returns nearsly half a BILLION results[^1], why should ***I*** create one? 

Surely any opinion piece I write will have been written better by someone more qualified, right?

As for coding tutorials, again, won't everything I create have already been done by someone with a PhD in computer science[^2]?  

While the answer to both of the questions above is more likely than not **"yes"**, it doesn't detract from the actual aim of this enterprise which is to provide a space for me to solidify my understanding of data science/ machine learning. How?
