![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about.jpg "Me Presenting in Nanjing, PRC")


I started coding in Python at the age of 35 while in graduate school (thanks [Sowmya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmya-vajjala-2a38734/))!. Since then, I have learned the unbridled joy of using R for creating maps and attending a data science bootcamp in Berlin.

When Iâ€™m not working, I can be found on the mats doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), doing yoga, or reading sci-fi.
