I started coding in Python at the age of 35 while in graduate school (thanks [Sowmya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmya-vajjala-2a38734/)). Since then, I have learned the unbridled joy of using [R for creating maps](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/) and attended a [data science bootcamp](https://youtu.be/BpOrMErz988) in Berlin where I completed a [projet](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity) using web scraping and machine learning (XGBoost, LSTM, and computer vision) to predict the minimum age necessary to read a book.

For a fuller picture of where I've been and what I've done, please see my [portfolio](https://educatorsrlearners.github.io/portfolio.github.io/)

When Iâ€™m not working, I can be found doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), yoga, or reading sci-fi.
