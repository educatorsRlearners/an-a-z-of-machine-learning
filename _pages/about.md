I started coding in Python at the age of 35 while in graduate school (thanks [Sowmya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmya-vajjala-2a38734/)). Since then, I have learned the unbridled joy of using [R for creating maps](https://educators-r-learners.netlify.app/) and attended a [data science bootcamp](https://youtu.be/BpOrMErz988) in Berlin.

When Iâ€™m not working, I can be found on the mats doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), doing yoga, or reading sci-fi.
