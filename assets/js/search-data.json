            "content": "What is a Decision Tree? . Decision Trees are a type of algorithm used for either classification or regression tasks. . How do they work? . While the math is fairly complicated, the concept is incredibly straightforward: . start with all observations in one group | identify a binary question, i.e., (&quot;yes/no&quot;, &quot;over/under&quot;) which results in two groups which are as distinct from eachother as possible | repeat step two until every subgroup homogeneous or some other metric has been achieved | What are the advantages? . Transparency: They are considered a white/glass box algorithm because you can see what decisions the algorithm made which leads to, . Interpretability: Again, since you can see which decisions were made, it&#39;s easy to comprehend and explain. . Ease: Data trees DO NOT require feature scaling or normalization1. . What are the disadvantages? . Overfitting: Since they try to find the purest groups, they have a tendacy to overfit. . Non-Linear Data: Relationships in the data between features are not considered. . How do we train a decision tree? . Step 1: Collect/Load our Data . We&#39;ll be using the Iris dataset compliments of sklearn. . from sklearn.datasets import load_iris iris = load_iris() X = iris.data y = iris.target . Step 2: Inspect our Data . Namely, do we have any missing values? . import numpy as np np.isnan(X).any() . False . Step 2 (Cont.): Visualize the Data . Let&#39;s see what our features are called: . iris.feature_names . [&#39;sepal length (cm)&#39;, &#39;sepal width (cm)&#39;, &#39;petal length (cm)&#39;, &#39;petal width (cm)&#39;] . Excellent! Now let&#39;s use those names to visualize our observations2. . sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width = 0, 1, 2, 3 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt formatter = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda i, *args: iris.target_names[int(i)]) plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) plt.scatter(iris.data[:, sepal_length], iris.data[:, sepal_width], c=iris.target) plt.colorbar(ticks=[0, 1, 2], format=formatter) plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[sepal_length]) plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[sepal_width]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() . Hmmmm. While setosa seams to be in a cluster of of its own, virginica and versicolor are intertwined. . What happens when we visualize based on petals. . formatter = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda i, *args: iris.target_names[int(i)]) plt.figure(figsize=(8,6)) plt.scatter(iris.data[:, petal_length], iris.data[:, petal_width], c=iris.target) plt.colorbar(ticks=[0, 1, 2], format=formatter) plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[petal_length]) plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[petal_width]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() . Now we&#39;re cookin! While there&#39;s some overlap between veriscolor and virginica, it&#39;s clear petal length and width are far better features for predictiong the type of flower than sepal length and width. Therefore, let&#39;s . Step 3: Prepare the data . Keep only the petal length and width feature colums: . X_new = iris.data[:, 2:] # petal length and width . and then . Step 4: Fit the model . from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0) tree_clf.fit(X_new, y) . DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight=None, criterion=&#39;gini&#39;, max_depth=None, max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, presort=False, random_state=0, splitter=&#39;best&#39;) . Visualzing the model . Earlier, I said it was easy to explain the decision the model made. . &quot;How?&quot; you ask? By visualizing it: . from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz dot_data = export_graphviz(tree_clf, out_file=None, feature_names=iris.feature_names[2:], class_names=iris.target_names, rounded=True, filled=True) from IPython.display import Image import pydotplus # Draw graph graph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data) # Show graph Image(graph.create_png()) .

            "title": "C is for Classification",
            "content": "What is classification? . Classification is one of two types of supervised machine learning tasks with the other being regression. . Key point to remember: supervised learning tasks use features to predict targets, or, in non-tech speak, they use attributes to predict something. For instance, we can take a basketball players height, weight, age, foot-speed and/or multiple other aspects their them to predict how many points they&#39;ll score or whether they will be an all-star. . So what&#39;s the difference between the two? . Regression tasks predict a continuous value For example, how many points someone will score. | . | Classification tasks predict a non-continuous value. For example, whether a player will be an all-star. | . | . How do I know which technique to use? . Answer the following question: &quot;Does my target variable have an order to it?&quot; . For example, my project predicting the recommended age of a reader was a regression task because I was predicting a precise age (i.e., 4 years old). If I was attempting to identify whether a book was suitable for teens or not, then it would have been a classification task since the answer would have been either yes or no. . OK, so classification is only for yes/no, true/false, cat/dog problems, right? . Nope, those are just the easy examples :smiley: . Example 1: Sorting People into Groups . Imagine a scenario where you get a new batch of students every year and have to sort them into houses based on their personality characteristics. . . In this situation, the houses do not have any type of sequence/ranking to them. Sure, Harry definitely didn&#39;t want to be housed in Slytherin, and the sorting hat clearly took that into consideration, but that doesn&#39;t mean Slytherin is closer to Gryffindor like 25 is closer to 30 than it is to 19. . Example 2: Applying Labels . Similarly, if we had a data set containing the ingredients of dishes and attempted to predict the country of origin, we&#39;d be solving a classification problem. Why? Because country names have no numerical order. We can say that Russia is the largest country on Earth or that China has the most people but those are attributes of the country (i.e., land size and population) which are not intrinsic to the name of the country. . Got it! Numbers are regression, words are classification . Sorry but no. . Think back to the book recommendation project I mentioned earlier. Answer this: if I wanted to predict whether a book was for: . small children (2-5 years old) | primary children (6 - 10) | tweens (11 -12) | young adults (13 - 17) | adults (18 +) | . what would you use: regression or classification? . Well, given that the labels have a clear order, you&#39;d definitely want to treat this as a regression problem by coding &#39;small children&#39; as &#39;1&#39; and &#39;adults&#39; as &#39;5&#39;1. . In Sum . Always start by asking &#39;What am I attempting to predict?&#39; Once that question is solved the rest becomes far simpler because as Jung said, &quot;To ask the right question, is already half the problem solved.&quot; .

            "content": "TLDR: . This blog is NOT: . a collection of answers to Udemy’s Machine Learning Course | . What this blog is: . a space for me to refine my thinking on machine learning principles and practices | an homage to An A-Z of ELT by Scott Thornbury | . Why another blog? . Good question. . True, I already have two blogs: one on EdTech and another on using R for data visualization. However, the real question is if a Google search for “data science blog” returns nearly half a BILLION results1, why should I create one? . Surely any opinion piece I write will have been written better by someone more qualified, right? . As for coding tutorials, again, won’t everything I create have already been done by someone with a PhD in computer science2? . While the answer to both of the questions above is more likely than not “yes”, it doesn’t detract from the actual aim of this enterprise which is to provide a space for me to solidify my understanding of data science/ machine learning. . How? . By writing about what I have learned, I will identity the areas where I am weak while solidifying the areas where I’m proficient. . But why do I think it will work? . Standing on the Shoulders of Giants . People who studied in the colleges of science and engineering are usually familiar Dr. Richard Feynmam. While he is famous for his work on quantum mechanics, his explanation of the Challenger disaster will forever be seared in my mind. . Why do I mention him? Feynman’s “notebook technique” is a model for learning anything: . Write down the concept you wish to master | Explain the concept in comprehensible language | Revise ideas/concepts which you can’t explain to a high standard | Identify complex areas and think of how to simplify them further (i.e., create analogies) | Or, to quote one of the true champions of teaching writing William Zinsser, “[w]riting and thinking and learning were the same process” and “Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought; a scientist who thinks clearly can write as well as the best writer.”3 . Or, to put it yet another way, we can cite a quote attributed to John Dewey, “We do not learn from experience […] but from reflecting on an experience.”4 . Or, in my own words, I am writing this blog to identify and shift concepts, ideas, and practices from the “Don’t Know” column into the “Do Know”. . Consequently, nothing original will be found on this blog because my purpose isn’t to discover some novel statistical technique nor propose a new theory; my aim is far humbler: increase my understanding of machine learning by clarifying my thinking through the process of writing. Shouldn’t be that hard, right :smirk: . But why the name? . A little more than a decade ago when I was an English language teacher (ELT) in Hanoi, Vietnam, I was introduced to the work of Scott Thornbury, who is a legend in ELT circles, and whose blog An A-Z of ELT was required reading for my colleagues and I. . But why should I use a similar name? . First, structure: there are 26 letters in the English alphabet meaning, at the minimum, I’m compelled to write 26 entries. How long will that take? That’s a good question that I’m not even going to attempt to answer. . Second, I just like the name and, honestly, what more reason do I need? :laughing: . Footnotes . Google search May 14th, 2020 &#8617; . | That is an idea for a future project, “What is the ratio of data science coding tutorials written by holders of PhDs compared to non-PhDs?” &#8617; . | From the “Preface” to Writing to Learn &#8617; . | This quote is most likely an amalgamation of several ideas which Dewey professed, but I still like it :smiley: &#8617; . |",
