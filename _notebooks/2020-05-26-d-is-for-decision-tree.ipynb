    "## *How do they work?*  \n",
    "While the math is [fairly complicated](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/understanding-the-mathematics-behind-decision-trees-22d86d55906), the concept is incredibly straightforward:  \n",
    "1. start with all observations in one group\n",
    "2. identify a binary question, i.e., (\"*yes/no*\", \"*over/under*\") which will lead to mostly homogeneous groups\n",
    "3. repeat step two until every subgroup homogeneous or some other metric has been achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the advantages?  \n",
    "**Transparency**: They are considered a [*white/glass box*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) algorithm because you can see what decisions the algorithm made which leads to,   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretablity**: Again, since you can see which decisions were made, it's easy to comprehend and explain. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ease**: Data trees **DO NOT** require feature scaling or normalization{% fn 1 %}.  \n",

    "**Overfitting**: Since they try to find the purest groups, they have a tendacy to overfit.  \n",
