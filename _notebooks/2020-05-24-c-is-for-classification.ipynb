    "# *What is **classification**?* \n",
    "**Classification** is one of two types of [supervised machine learning tasks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/supervised-and-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms/) with the other being **regression**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Key point to remember: supervised learning tasks use features to predict targets, or, in non-tech speak, they use attributes to predict something. For instance, we can take a basketball players height, weight, age, foot-speed and/or multiple other aspects their them to predict how many points they'll score or whether they will be an all-star.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *So what's the difference between the two?* \n",
    "- Regression tasks predict a *continuous* value\n",
    " - For example, how many points someone will score.\n",
    "- Classification tasks predict a *non-continuous* value.\n",
    " - For example, whether a player will be an all-star. \n",
    " \n",
    "# *How do I know which technique to use?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following question: ***\"Does my target variable have an order to it?\"***  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [my project predicting the recommended age of a reader](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity) was a *regression* task because I was predicting a precise **age** (i.e., 4 years old). If I was attempting to identify whether a book was suitable for teens or not, then it would have been a *classification* task since the answer would have been either **yes** or **no**. \n",
    "\n",
    "# *OK, so classification is only for yes/no, true/false, cat/dog problems, right?*\n",
    "Nope, those are just the easy examples :smiley:\n",
